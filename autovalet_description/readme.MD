# autovalet_description

This is the AutoValet Husky URDF package. For our project, we use a modified version of the Husky with a Velodyne LiDAR and 2 Intel Realsense D435s on it. We call the standard Clearpath Husky URDF with our `autovalet.urdf.xacro` as an extra. The xacro file launches the sensors and defines the transforms between the sensors and the body of the robot. The URDF is published to ROS by running `autovalet_description.launch`. 


**This is simply a helper package used to run the robot in the simulated gazebo world. To see the robot's sensor stream in the gazebo world, please refer to the `autovalet_gazebo` package.**


## Loading the robot model in isolation
In order to just view the robot model generated by the URDF (not recommended), please launch robot state publisher and the joint state publisher along with the autovalet_description.launch file.

## Running shit

roslaunch autovalet_description autovalet_description.launch
